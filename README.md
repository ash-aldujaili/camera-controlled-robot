# camera-controlled-robot


This repository hosts the code for a camera-controlled robot using `MATLAB` and `ARDUINO`

For more details and demo, refer to this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F91fNlQ-ADs).

This was a project with my coursemates: Amr (3asaleya) and Haytham (Haysooma), who handled elegantly the mechanical and hardware aspects of the robot.


Do let me know if you spin something off this code.
